# musicmap 
### http://music-map.herokuapp.com/

This was a small project to play around with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [JQVMap](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/jqvmap). 

The goal was to display a map to the user, allowing him/her to click on a country and display the top tracks for that country. The data for this project was provided by [Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/api).

For this small project it was easier to keep the [server](../server.js) and [client](../client) in the same repository.
